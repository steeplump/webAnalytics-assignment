Link to dataset:

https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions


Stuff to do:

1. Sentiment analysis on reviews 
2. Find relationships between highest rated recipes and other characteristics (eg. long review = high rating?)
3. Market basket analysis on recipes' ingredients lists


Notes:

* Submit everything as a single R markdown doc (report + analysis)
* Difference between "lessons learned" and "reflection": 
  Lessons learned -> what you learned from the data, conclusion of assignment
  Reflection -> what you learned from performing analysis, how you appreciate data and data analytics more, personal lessons
